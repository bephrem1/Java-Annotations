# Java-Annotations
Practice with Java Annotations and Reflection (TeamTreehouse Project)

Instructor/Code: Chris Ramacciotti

Explanation: Practice with Java annotations and reflection. Analyzing a class for proper documentation.

Comments: The concept of reflection is really interesting in that you can thoroughly analyze a class as you'd like
and make dynamic changes if you wish. In this project we analyzed a class simply to check for proper documentation
after creating an annotation. Commented personal notes for later review of concepts.
